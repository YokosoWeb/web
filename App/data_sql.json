As the name suggests, repo linked lending rate or RLLR is the lending rate which is linked to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/tag/rbi/\" target=\"_blank\">RBI</a>&rsquo;s repo rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Repo linked lending rate (RLLR): From October 1, 2019, all new floating rate personal or retail loans such as your car or home loans that are sanctioned by banks will have to be linked to external benchmarks, and the central bank&rsquo;s repo rate is one of them. Every bank will have its own Repo linked lending rate or RLLR which will keep varying each time the Reserve Bank of India or the RBI revises the repo rate. For the uninitiated, repo rate is the rate at which banks borrow from the RBI. The central bank reviews the repo rate on a bi-monthly basis through its Monetary Policy Committee or MPC.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is repo linked lending rate?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what is RLLR? As the name suggests, repo linked lending rate or RLLR is the lending rate which is linked to the RBI&rsquo;s repo rate. However, the effective RLLR interest rate depends on multiple factors. For example, the RLLR-linked home loan interest rate will depend on several factors such as what the loan amount is, the loan-to-value of the loan and even the risk group of the borrower, amongst other things. There can be a Spread or Margin charged by the bank. To explain, a bank may have an RLLR of 6.5 per cent, but the actual home loan interest could be 7.5 per cent, of which 1 per cent will be the Spread or Margin of the bank. Banks are free to fix Margin while lending to the borrowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How does RLLR home loan work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When banks borrow funds from the RBI, it is at the repo rate. Lowering of repo rate by the RBI makes banks lend at a lower rate. Therefore, in case of lending based on RLLR, the home loan interest rate will move up or down as per the movement in the repo rate. Let us see with the help of an example. Say, the RBI&rsquo;s repo rate is 5.35 per cent and is cut by 35 basis points to settle at 5 per cent, the RLLR of all banks, having repo rate as the external benchmark, will also get reduced by 35 basis points. If the repo rate, in the above example is hiked, the scenario is reversed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is MCLR linked interest rate? Why is RLLR replacing MCLR?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever the RBI revises the repo rate, the Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate or MCLR of banks gets impacted. Any cut in the repo rate means that the banks can lower the MCLR and vice versa. However, it has been observed that there is a time lag in the passing of repo rate cuts from banks to the borrowers. In case MCLR linked interest rate, the entire repo rate cut benefit is not passed on. In RLLR loans, the transmission is quicker as compared to MCLR loans. Typically, in the case of MCLR-based loans the reset period is 12 months. When the interest rate is on a downward trend, the RLLR home loans would suit borrowers. Conversely, they may hurt borrowers in the rising interest rate scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RLLR vs MCLR home loan</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>MCLR is primarily an internal benchmark of the bank as its own cost of funds will determine the MCLR of the bank. However, in the case of RLLR which is externally linked, the bank&rsquo;s own cost of funds does not have a direct impact when the repo rate goes up or comes down. In the case of RLLR home loans, the interest rate will be linked to the bank&rsquo;s RLLR. This RLLR, in turn, will depend on the RBI&rsquo;s repo rate. Whenever the RBI revises the repo rate, RLLR of banks gets impacted. Any cut in the repo rate will help banks in lowering RLLR and vice versa. RLLR, therefore, is an external benchmark.</li>\r\n\t<li>The reset period in MCLR linked home loan is generally 12 months while a few banks have a 6-month too. Whatever the reset period is, the home loan interest rate and hence the EMI gets revised accordingly. This gives a time-lag to MCLR-based loans. However, in the case of RLLR based home loans, the reset-period for the interest rate and hence the EMI to reset is to be at least three months.</li>\r\n\t<li>In the case MCLR loans, the banks are allowed to charge a spread, mark-up or margin. For example, if the MCLR of the bank is 8.6 per cent, then it may lend at 9 per cent after factoring in 40 basis points of mark-up. In RLLR, the Spread is as per the loan amount and the risk group of the borrower.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Let&rsquo;s consider a simple example to understand the differences between MCLR and RLLR. For a fair comparison, the effective home loan interest is being taken at 8.5 per cent under both the scenarios &ndash; RLLR and MCLR home loan. This will remain the same through the term of the loans. In practice, being flexible loans, the rates will vary and typically MCLR loans will come at a higher rate of interest. Assuming one has to take a loan of Rs 50 lakh for 15 years, let us look at the difference in EMIs and interest burden.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MCLR home loan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rs 49,237 EMI remains constant for the entire 180 months period. The total interest paid over these months amounts to about Rs 38,62,656.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RLLR home loan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an RLLR loan, two payments will be made separately. One, for the principal repayment and other for the interest payment. For RLLR loan, the principal loan amount is divided by tenure to know the EMP or equated monthly principal. This comes to Rs 27,778 in the example under consideration, and it will remain the same through the loan term. In the case of RLLR home loan, the interest payments will vary each month. They will be the highest in the first month and then keep falling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"RLLR, repo linked lending rate\" src=\"https://images.financialexpress.com/2019/09/MCLR-vs-RLLR.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interest saved under RLLR loan: The borrower has to Rs 35,417 in the first month and by the 180th month, the interest portion comes down to around Rs 200. As per the RLLR amortization schedule, the total monthly payment for RLLR home loan is actually more than the MCLR home loan for the initial few years. This then tapers off in the subsequent years. For a 15 year loan, after a period of 6 years, the monthly payments witness a drastic fall as compared to the EMI in MCLR loan. For other scenarios, the calculations could work out differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But most importantly, the comparison tells us that the total interest burden is lesser in RLLR loans than MCLR loans. The above example helps understand how EMIs and interest burden differ, and by what extent is the interest cost expected to be lower in the case of RLLR loans. In this example, almost Rs 6.5 lakh lesser interest is paid in RLLR loan, primarily because the repayments are higher in initial years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>https://www.financialexpress.com/what-is/repo-linked-lending-rate-rllr-meaning/1715264/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "author": 11, "slug": "Are-you-aware-of-RLLR-MCLR", "status": "Published", "image": "images/1.PNG", "category": [1]}}, {"model": "Subapp01.post", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "How to Improve Your Credit Score Fast?", "meta": "", "date": "2021-10-08", "content": "<h1>How to Improve Your Credit Score Fast</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>You will raise your credit score by taking a few quick steps, such as opening credit lines that submit your payment history to credit bureaus, keeping low balances, and settling your bills every month. That being said, deciding where to begin can be challenging. If you&rsquo;re starting afresh or improving your credit following a setback, it&rsquo;s important to understand how credit ratings are determined as well as how to increase them. Then, depending on the case, you should go further into more thorough guides.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Credit scores and how they are calculated</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit scores are calculated using scoring methods which are computational programs that review one of the credit histories from Experian, TransUnion, or Equifax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To calculate a specific score, scoring systems (of which there are many) may use multiple aspects of the same variables weighted separately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit ratings, on the other hand, have a few things in common:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The data in one of your&nbsp;credit reports are used to determine your score.</li>\r\n\t<li>For the next 24 months, scoring models attempt to determine when a consumer would be ninety days overdue on a payment.</li>\r\n\t<li>A higher score means that an individual becomes less likely to ignore a payment and vice versa.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The FICO and VantageScore&reg; rating models are used by a large number of banks to measure creditworthiness. The most current iterations of their basic credit ratings have a range of 300 to 850 points, with a rating in the mid-600s or above being deemed nice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FICO also develops industry-specific ranking templates ranging from 250 to 900 points for automotive dealers and credit card companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that multiple credit ratings use the same raw data to attempt to forecast the same result, it&rsquo;s not shocking that taking measures to boost one rating will allow you to improve all of your credit scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having on-time payments, for example, will boost all of your credit ratings, while skipping a payment would actually harm all of them. Your credit ratings can be influenced by a number of factors. We&rsquo;ll concentrate on the steps you should take to boost your creditworthiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Examine the credit reports</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing what could be going in your favor will help you boost your credit (or against you). That&rsquo;s where a credit background review comes in handy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion are the three main national credit bureaus where you can get a copy of your credit score. You will do this once a year for free by visiting the official AnnualCreditReport.com website. Then look over each study and see what is improving or affecting the overall ranking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A history of on-time payments, low credit card balances, a combination of separate credit card and loan accounts, older credit accounts, and minimal credit inquiries all lead to a higher credit score. Credit score skeptics have late or missing fees, heavy credit card balances, defaults, and decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>READ&nbsp;&nbsp;How to get a Mortgage with Bad Credit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 90% of major lenders use FICO credit ratings, which are made up of five different factors:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>History of payments (35 percent )</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit use (30 percent )</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit cards&rsquo; age (15 percent )</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mixture of credit (10 percent )</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit inquiries (10 percent )</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Payment history, as you can see, has the most effect on your credit rating. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s preferable to have paid-off obligations, such as old student loans, sit on your credit report. It works in your favor if you paid your loans responsibly and on schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoiding late fees at all costs is a simple way to boost your credit score. Here are few pointers about how to go about it:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating a paper or automated file system for keeping track of monthly bills<br />\r\nSet up due-date reminders so you know when a bill is due<br />\r\nBill transfers from your bank account can be automated<br />\r\nAnother alternative is to charge all (or however many) of your monthly bill payments to a credit card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To stop interest charges, this plan ensures that you can pay the balance in full per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you take this path, you can find that it simplifies bill payments and improves your credit score by establishing a track record of on-time payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Aim for a credit usage rate of 30 percent or less</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit utilization applies to how much of the credit balance you&rsquo;re used at any given time. It&rsquo;s the second most significant consideration in FICO credit score calculations, after payment history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paying off your credit card balances in full per month is the easiest way to keep your credit usage in check. If you can&rsquo;t always do this, a reasonable rule of thumb is to keep your gross outstanding balance at 30% of your total credit cap or less. After that, you should focus on reducing it to 10% or less, which is considered optimal for improving your credit score.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to boost your credit usage ratio is to request an increase in your credit cap. Raising your credit cap will make you use your credit more efficiently, as long as your debt does not rise at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can submit a credit balance raise from most credit card providers online; all you have to do is change your total household income. In less than a minute, you might be approved for a higher cap. You may also order a raise in the credit balance over the internet. A further way to boost your credit usage ratio is to request a raise in your credit cap. Raising your credit cap will make you use your credit more efficiently, as long as your debt does not rise at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Requests for new credit&mdash;and &ldquo;Hard&rdquo; inquiries&mdash;should be kept to a minimum<br />\r\nInquests into your credit records can be divided into two categories: &ldquo;strong&rdquo; and &ldquo;weak.&rdquo; Checking your own credit, allowing a prospective employer to check your credit, checks performed by financial firms for which you currently do business, and credit card providers checking your file to see if they wish to give you pre-approved credit deals are all examples of soft inquiries. Your credit score would not be affected by soft inquiries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hard investigations, on the other hand, may have a negative impact on your credit report for anything from a couple of months to two years. Applications for a new credit card, a mortgage, an auto loan, or some kind of new credit are all considered hard inquiries. The occasional tough question is unlikely to have much of an impact. However, a large number of them in a limited period of time will negatively impact your credit score. Banks will interpret this to mean that you need funds due to financial difficulty, making you a higher risk. Avoid searching for new loans for a bit if you&rsquo;re working to raise your credit score.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Add some bulk to your thin credit history</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have enough payment history on your record to produce a credit rating if you have a slim credit sheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an epidemic that affects approximately 62 million Americans. Fortunately, there are options to build credit and improve your credit score if you have a slim credit sheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UltraFICO is a related product. This free program calculates your FICO score based on your banking background. Growing a savings margin, keeping a checking account over time, paying your bills from your bank account on time, and preventing overdrafts are all things that can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For landlords, there is a third choice. If you pay your rent on a monthly basis, there are some utilities that can offer you credit for on-time payments. For example, Rental Kharma and RentTrack will report your rent payments to the credit bureaus on your behalf, potentially improving your credit score. Notice that only your VantageScore credit ratings, not your FICO score, will be affected by disclosing rent payments. Any rent monitoring agencies charge a premium for this program, so make sure you read the fine print and understand just what you&rsquo;re having and potentially paying for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perch, a smartphone app that records rent payments to credit bureaus for free, is a recent addition to the field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Maintain old accounts and address delinquencies</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have old credit cards that you aren&rsquo;t using, keep them open. Although the credit records on those accounts will appear on your credit report, closing credit cards while you have a balance on others will reduce your usable credit and boost your credit usage ratio. It&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;ll lose a couple of points as a result of this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take steps to fix any outstanding accounts, charge-offs, or collection reports you may have. For example, if you have an account with several late or missed payments, get caught up on the past due balance first, then devise a strategy for getting potential payments on time. This will not remove the late fees, so it will help you boost your payment history in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you have charge-offs or collection reports, consider whether it&rsquo;s better to pay them off in full or make a mediation deal to the borrower. Paid collection accounts have a lower negative effect in newer FICO and VantageScore credit-scoring models. Paying off collections or charge-offs could improve your credit score slightly. Remember that unfavorable account records can stay on your credit report for up to seven years, and bankruptcies can stay on your credit report for up to ten years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Debt consolidation is a viable option</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a lot of loans, it might be beneficial to take out a debt relief loan from a bank or credit union to pay them off all at once. You&rsquo;ll just have to live with one&nbsp;mortgage because if you can get a cheaper interest rate&nbsp;on the loan, you&rsquo;ll be able to pay off the debt sooner. Your credit usage ratio and, as a result, your credit score can increase as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consolidating various credit card accounts and paying them off with a balance transfer credit card is a similar strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These cards also have a discount time during which you pay no interest on the balance. Balance transfer fees, on the other hand, will cost you anywhere from 3% to 5% of the money you transfer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Monitor your credit score to see how far you&rsquo;ve come</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit management systems make it easy to keep track of your credit score over time<br />\r\nThese sites, all of which are free, keep an eye on your credit report for any shifts, such as a paid-off account or a new account you&rsquo;ve opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They usually provide you with regular updates on at least one of your credit ratings from Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the best credit reporting systems will also assist you with preventing fraud and identity theft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should call the credit card provider to investigate alleged theft if you get a warning that a new credit card account that you don&rsquo;t recall opening is being reported to your report.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Final thoughts on how to improve your credit score fast</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Working to improve your credit rating is a wonderful benchmark to have, particularly if you want to&nbsp;apply for a loan&nbsp;to make a big investment like a new vehicle or home, or if you want to qualify for one of the best loyalty cards available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you begin taking action to improve your ranking, it can take several weeks, if not months, to make a significant difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any of the derogatory marks may require the assistance of one of the best credit restoration firms. However, the quicker you start working on improving your credit, the more you&rsquo;ll see success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.integratedloans.com/how-to-improve-your-credit-score-fast/?fbclid=IwAR1JvgENioWlBi6ejMnww1Dj8eCS9rLDEOdOm8jNptHb5b0Tu_ZWraFhoNM\">https://www.integratedloans.com/how-to-improve-your-credit-score-fast/?fbclid=IwAR1JvgENioWlBi6ejMnww1Dj8eCS9rLDEOdOm8jNptHb5b0Tu_ZWraFhoNM</a></p>", "author": 11, "slug": "Improve_Your_Credit_Score_Fast", "status": "Published", "image": "images/2.png", "category": [1]}}, {"model": "Subapp01.post", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "Good Loan Vs.

All credits are bad credit! No. It&#39;s hard for one to lead a life without taking credit. Unless you are blessed with plenty of assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Good Loans:</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Home Loan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Home loan allows you to purchase an asset that will provide you with regular income if you rent it out. Also, since real estate prices are likely to rise over time, you may be able to earn a good price when you sell it. Furthermore, a home loan comes with tax advantages.

There will be no limit on tax deductions for interest payments if you put it on rent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the monthly payments on a home loan might be significantly lower than on other loans because the interest rate is typically between 7% and 8% each year. Given the bad economic conditions that have persisted as a result of COVID-19, it could fall even farther. Your payback cycle will be rather long because this loan is for a long period of time, i.e. 20-30 years. Paying your EMIs on time for a long time can only help you build an excellent credit score.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Benefits:</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>There are number of tax deductions available under home loan, which makes home loan a biggest tax saving instrument.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Under Section 80C deduction for stamp duty and registration charge can be availed with 1.5 lakh rupees as limit.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Tax deduction under section 80EEA of upto Rs. 1.5 lakh</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>House is generally a &quot;appreciating: asset.

On average, people with a bachelor&#39;s degree earn 66 percent more in their lifetime than those without one. And, with today&#39;s shortage of tradespeople, individuals who take on a tiny bit of debt to finish trade school considerably boost their earning potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Benefits</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Build positive credit history: To get a loan in future you should have good credit history. For which you should have taken loan. Education loan being a first loan that you will get.

Whereas with the banks, interest is fixed.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bad loans</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The title suggests that the loans that will be discussed here are bad and should be avoided. These loans do not provide you with much benefit. If you pay your bills on time, they may be able to assist you in obtaining a decent credit score. Aside from that, there isn&#39;t much to brag about. Let&#39;s take a look at some examples of bad loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Using Credit Cards or Loans to Purchase Smartphones</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We all live in a world where we tend to follow our friends in order to avoid being distracted. Many of us use loans or credit cards to purchase expensive mobile phones like iPhones in order to retain social respect and keep up with our friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are utilising your savings to purchase such accessories, there is no harm in having them. The reason that using loans or credit cards is not a good idea is because the value of these phones drops dramatically and quickly. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if phone prices fell by 30 percent to 40 percent or more in a year. As a result, the money you spend for these phones through loans or credit cards will be far higher than the money you could earn if you sold them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Car Loan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the high cost of cars, you will have to take out a loan to purchase one. An automobile, like smartphones, is a fixed asset with steep price drops over time. So, if you don&#39;t need a car, don&#39;t take out a loan to acquire one. The loan payment will be substantially higher than the proceeds from the sale of the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Problems:</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Depreciation:&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, the price of a car begins to decrease the instant it leaves the showroom and reaches the road. And, after 2-3 years of purchase, the car&#39;s price can drop to half of what it was at the time of purchase</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Car loan interest takes 7&nbsp;&nbsp;years to complete, In meantime there could be an emergency situation where you need to finance a loan. It is always advisable to take out loans only for &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; reasons.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>If you need a car but you are short of funds, It is better to go with second hand cars. Banks provide loan for 85% of car value, If possible, it is better to pay beforehand as much as possible and then take loan for the remaining amount.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Investing with a Loan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The prospect of investing in stocks and profiting handsomely from them can entice you. However, do not take out a loan to invest in such opportunities. The reason is straightforward. Stocks can provide substantial returns, but they can also be a dangerous investment. Due to persistently negative market emotions, the stocks you acquire may crash, resulting in a bombardment of losses for you to deal with. Also, if you&#39;re considering taking out a loan to invest in debt instruments, reconsider. The returns on debt products like bonds and debentures will be far lower than the interest you&#39;ll pay on a loan. use your savings and not take a loan for the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of Good loan vs bad loan is subjective. It could change based on several criterions. Analysing about type of loan could help take better decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "author": 12, "slug": "Good-Loan-Vs-Bad-Loan-What-s-the-Difference", "status": "Published", "image": "images/goodvsbadloanyok.png", "category": [1]}}, {"model": "Subapp01.post", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "Pension Loan", "meta": "pension loan", "date": "2021-10-19", "content": "<h1><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">What is a pension loan?</span></span></span></h1>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:48px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Pension loan is a loan provided for borrowers who earn pension.
